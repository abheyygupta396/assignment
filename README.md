I have used JSP, Servlets, MySQL, ApacheTomcatServer and Scripting languages like Html Css to create this WebApplication.

This is a simple project created for a doctor to create its personal record including all the CRUD opertations performed in it.

Libraries used as:- 

mysql.connector 5.1.5.jar
common csv 1.2.jar
jdk 1.8(default)
ApacheTomcatServer 8.0.27.0
jstl 1.2.jar

Deployed the project with the help of NetBeans IDE versioning method to initilaize its control system called Git which makes to deploy the project on Github 
using Commit & Pushing the Project.

Check Out the respective Code from the master branch.
